                              JMESPath is an optional JMESPath expression to apply to the image value.
                              This is useful when the extracted image begins with a prefix like 'docker://'.
                              The 'trim_prefix' function may be used to trim the prefix: trim_prefix(@, 'docker://').
                              Note - Image digest mutation may not be used when applying a JMESPAth to an image.

                              It should be slash-separated. Each slash-separated key must be a valid YAML key or a wildcard '*'.
                              Wildcard keys are expanded in case of arrays or objects.
